Day1:
1. Avoid setting a height to anything in css.
2. When you set widths, they are in relation to their parent.
3. Use percentages for widths
4. Webpages are responsive by default. It is us that makes them unresponsive with our poor css
5. box-sizing: border-box; when you add padding and border to a div, it increases the width and size of the div. By setting box-sizing: border-box, the max size of the box shrinks down to accomidate any border and padding. By doing this we can set divs to be 100% width and not have them overflow
